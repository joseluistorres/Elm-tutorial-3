# Elm tutorial 3.


A simple Todo App made with Elm.

This version has full styling pulled in through Bootstrap, etc. 

Run `elm package install` before running `elm reactor` or `elm make` so that this app will actually be able to build. 

You can also dynamically build the application by copy and pasting the code into the [elm try online app](http://elm-lang.org/try). (make sure to remove the first line of code first).
